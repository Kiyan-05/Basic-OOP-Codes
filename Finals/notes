Abstract
---------
Cant do "new" on an abstract class because you can't instantiate objects with abstract classes

if the non-abstract class is inheriting an abstract class and has an abstract method, it should be Overrided
if the abstract class is inheriting an abstract class and has an abstract method, it is not required to override it but if it is overrided, the non-abstract that is inheriting that abstract class, so there's no need to override it
