1. Class for Matrix of numbers
2. Note: 9 is the max rounds, 7 is the least, and 5 is the minimum rounds
3. make function, isWin: to check if the min round pick is aligned straight/diagonal
4. function/class for Player
5. 2D Array = coordinates of numbers -> Number class


Note: if the num is picked (isPicked), return invalid and retry turn

if 5/7 (iteration) -> isWin (check matrix and player) - must not override 
if 9 -> default print -> Draw

Player 1 = X
Player 2 = O

1. Players Turn = 9 max turns
2. Enter chosen number (1-9)
3. check if valid number (compare the value in the number array)
4. Store or pass the value (coordinates)
4. print matrix with replaced string
